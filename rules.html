    <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; max-width: 800px;">
        <li><strong>1. Respect the Creative Process</strong><br>
            Appreciate your classmates' work and give constructive feedback. Don't copy others' designs—plagiarism is not tolerated.
        </li>
        <li><strong>2. Come Prepared</strong><br>
            Bring necessary materials (sketchbook, USB drive, headphones, etc.). Have assignments and projects ready on time.
        </li>
        <li><strong>3. Use Equipment Responsibly</strong><br>
            Handle computers, tablets, and software with care. Save your work frequently and back it up regularly.
        </li>
        <li><strong>4. Follow Digital Etiquette</strong><br>
            Use design software and the internet only for class-related work. No gaming, social media, or unrelated browsing during class.
        </li>
        <li><strong>5. Be On Time &amp; Stay Engaged</strong><br>
            Arrive on time and stay focused throughout class. Use class time wisely; stay on task and meet deadlines.
        </li>
        <li><strong>6. Clean Up Your Workspace</strong><br>
            Log off computers and shut them down properly. Return materials and leave your area tidy.
        </li>
        <li><strong>7. Ask Questions &amp; Collaborate</strong><br>
            Don't be afraid to ask for help or share ideas. Support and encourage your classmates' growth.
        </li>
        <li><strong>8. Meet Deadlines</strong><br>
            Late work may affect your grade unless prior arrangements are made. Plan your time—design takes more effort than you think!
        </li>
        <li><strong>9. Follow All School Policies</strong><br>
            Adhere to the school's rules on behavior, internet use, and academic honesty.
        </li>
    </ul>
